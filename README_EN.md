# 🧮 Basic Logic Calculator

A simple **propositional logic calculator**.  
It allows you to enter logical expressions with operators and generates the **solution** along with a **truth table** of all possible values.  

> ⚠️ Note: if the proposition is too long, the calculator solves it, but the table will be truncated.

- ✔️ Display a **truth table** with all possible results.  
- ✔️ Basic graphical interface with `tkinter`.
